# This is a modified version of https://github.com/jcfaria/ScottKnott/blob/master/R/MaxValue.R which is originally written by Jose Claudio Faria
# Change Notes:
# - Add an 'av' argument into the Partition() function
# - Remove the calculation of a lamdaa and a Chi-square distribution
# - Use Cohen d to check the effect size difference with the diff() function
