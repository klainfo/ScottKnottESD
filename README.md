# The Non-Parametric ScottKnott ESD test (Version 3.0, the development branch) 

The Non-Parametric ScottKnott ESD (NPSK) test is a multiple comparison approach that leverages a hierarchical clustering to partition the set of median values of techniques (e.g., medians of variable importance scores, medians of model performance) into statistically distinct groups with non-negligible difference.
The Non-Parametric Scott-Knott ESD test is recommended that other multiple comparison tests, since it does not produce overlapping groups like other post-hoc tests (e.g., Nemenyiâ€™s test) and it does not require the assumptions of normal distributions, homogeneous distributions, and the minimum sample size.
Thus, this Non-Parametric ScottKnott ESD (NPSK) test does not require any basic ANOVA assumptions of the original ScottKnott test.

The mechanism of the Non-Parametric Scott-Knott ESD test is made up of 2 steps:

* **(Step 1) Find a partition that maximizes treatment means between groups.** We begin by sorting the median value of the distributions. Then, we compute the Kruskal Chisq statistics to identify a partition that maximizes the median values between groups. The Kruskal Chisq test is a non-parametric test, which does not require data normality and data heterogeneity assumptions.
* **(Step 2) Splitting into two groups or merging into one group.** We analyze the magnitude of the difference for each pair for all of the treatment medians of the two groups. If there is any one pair of treatment medians of two groups are non-negligible, we split into two groups. Otherwise, we merge into one group. We use the Cliff $|\delta|$ effect size to estimate the effect size of the difference between the two medians.


# Release Notes

V3.0.0 - The Non-Parametric ScottKnott ESD test. (Pending approval to be available in CRAN)

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("klainfo/ScottKnottESD", ref="development")
# Using Non-Parametric ScottKnott ESD test
sk <- sk_esd(example, version="np")
```

V2.0.3 - The Parametric ScottKnott ESD test (v2.x) produces the ranking of treatment means while ensuring that (1) the magnitude of the difference for all of the treatments in each group is negligible; and (2) the magnitude of the difference of treatments between groups is non-negligible. [Tantithamthavorn et al., (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2018.2794977>]
